## Technology Stack

### 1. Core Java Concepts

- **GUI**: Implemented with Java Swing for interactive user interfaces.
- **File I/O**: Used for persistent data storage, such as:
  - Saving user information during registration.
  - Validating login credentials.
  - Storing and retrieving ingredient data.
  - Sorting ingredients by expiration date.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Designed a hierarchical structure for fridge, freezer, and room temperature classes, inheriting common functionality from a `Refrigerator` class. Polymorphism was used to handle these subclasses in the `OpenRefrigerator` GUI.

### 2. Development Tools

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **IDE**: Recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- **File System**: Text-based file storage for user and ingredient data.
